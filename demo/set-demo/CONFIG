Base case +

3 similar sources, 3 different similar files each of size 10MB. File
to be downloaded is 15% similar to each of these similar files but the
similar blocks in each similar file are disjoint with respect to each
other. So the overall similarity of the file to be downloaded with all
the similar files is 15*3 = 45%
