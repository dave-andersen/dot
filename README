                                DOT Installation   
                            ########################

To build DOT, there are two steps:

  1.  Build sfslite2
  2.  Build DOT

Step 1.
~~~~~~

  You need sfslite2 version 1.2 or later.  Please do the 
  following ($DOTROOT is the top-level DOT source tree):

    $ svn checkout svn://svn.okws.org/sfslite2/devel/1.2 sfslite2

    ** Patch your sfslite according to patches/README (in DOT src/trunk)
    $ cd sfslite2
    $ sh -x setup.gnu -f -i -s
    $ ./configure
    $ make
     
  See http://www.okws.org/doku.php?id=sfslite for more information.

Step 2.
~~~~~~

    $ cd $DOTROOT

  To configure the first time you checkout:

    $ autoreconf -i -s

  To build, do the usual (out-of-directory builds work too):

    $ ./configure --with-sfs=/path/to/sfslite2
    $ make

  Other useful options:
  
    To specify a path to the BerkeleyDB libraries
      $ ./configure --with-sfs=... --with-db=/usr
  
    Libraries are static by default; to make binary programs static too:
      $ LDFLAGS=-static ./configure ...
      (or the equivalent for your shell)
  
--------------------------------------------------------------
---- System specific configuration and installation nodes ----
--------------------------------------------------------------

Linux (tested on Ubuntu 6.10)
  - install autoconf, libtool, libgmp3-dev, byacc, flex,
    libssl-dev libbdb4.4++-dev (or something like that)

FreeBSD 5.x
  - You must use the "gnu-{autoconf,automake,libtool}"
    packages to compile DOT.  The default FreeBSD installs of automake, etc.,
    are hacked to work with the ports system and will not work for DOT.

  - You must install the openssl package or port.  The default FreeBSD
    openssl does not include the pkg-config file for openssl.

  - You must have pkgconfig installed

  - You must copy the "pkg.m4" file from /usr/local/share/aclocal
    into /usr/local/gnu-autotools/share/aclocal/
    before running autoreconf.

  - Use gmake and not make

FreeBSD 6.x:
  - You don't have to install gnu-libtool, just the other two
  - Use gmake and not make
  - You must also copy "libtool.m4" from /usr/local/share/aclocal
    into /usr/local/gnu-autotools/share/aclocal
  - Put /usr/local/gnu-autotools/bin in your path (don't run the
    autotools from /usr/local/bin)

OS X:
  If using macports,
   - sudo port install db44 (or 45 or 46, as appropriate)
   - sudo port install libgmp
   - configure --with-sfs=/path/to/your/sfs --with-gmp=/opt/local --with-db=/opt/local

---- Cygwin -----

First, ensure that the necessary Cygwin packages are installed
to compile and run the sfslite and DOT code:
   make, bison, flex, automake, autoconf, libtool, pkg-config, 
   libgmp, minires-devel, sunrpc

Next, you'll need to add modern function prototypes to the sunrpc
header files.  The Cygwin default sunrpc package provides header files
in /usr/include/rpc/ that date from the mid 80s.  Unfortunately, the
headers use K&R syntax, which g++ strongly dislikes because of C++'s
strong type checking.  To correct this, you'll need to add the argument
prototypes for a number of functions in the directory.

XXX - we need to clarify these instructions more and make sure
they're complete.
