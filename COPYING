DOT is distributed under the Eclipse Public License.  Note, however,
that to actually be used, DOT must be compiled against the sfslite
libraries and programs or an equivalent set of libraries that provide
the same functions.  Some of the sfslite libraries, programs, and
header files are licensed under the GPL.  So, practically speaking,
you won't be able to redistribute compiled binary copies of
DOT+sfslite without making all of the source code available, and it's
a bit murky.

Our hope is to make DOT as widely used and easy to distribute as
possible.  If you'd like to have the code under a different license
(the DOT code, not the sfslite code), please just ask.
