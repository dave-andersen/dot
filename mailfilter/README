This directory is for the progras that run as sendmail/mailavenger
filters and collect traces for later analysis.

Compiling the sendmail milter requires a bit of hackery; you must have
the sendmail source installed somewhere convenient, and have built the
libmilter.a library

I check out a copy of sendmail into the same place I create my DOT
build directory, and compile this way:

gcc mfmilter.c -I../../sendmail-8.13.4 -L ../../sendmail-8.13.4/libmilter/ -I../../sendmail-8.13.4/include -lmilter -pthread -o mfmilter

Not pretty, but we can worry about prettifying it later if we want.
Getting all of this integrated with libasync could be an adventure, if
we go that route.
