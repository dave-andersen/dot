Capturing mail traces:
  pack_mfmilter.pl is a utility script to pack the 
  per-message log files into one file.  Save an inode,
  run this script somewhat regularly. 

Analyzing the mail capture files:

  1)  Put them in the 'mail' subdirectory (or whatever you choose)
      The "mlog.rb" library understands how to deal with a directory
      full of packed mail logs created by the pack_mfmilter.pl script.

  2)  run mailparse.rb <subdir>

    -> This creates sharedbodies.hist and wholesize.cdf
    which you can graph as described below

  3)  If you wish to create a the "simulated" email messages to
      feed to postscript:
       - mkdir out
       - run mailregen.rb <subdir>

      This will populate 'out' with a huge batch of generated
      emails that have the same chunk hash values as the 
      originals (but random content).
