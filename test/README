Test layout:
 - gcp_test.sh:
   A good, verbose, "my system isn't working" base test.
   Spawns two gtcds in xterms, runs gcp over ssh to localhost
   to copy a file.  You need to be able to ssh in to your
   local machine for this test to work.
   (Uses other_gcp.sh)

 - dot-test.rb:
   A more comprehensive set of tests that don't provide as much
   useful debugging output, but test more things.
   (requires spawn_buffered.rb and unit_test_hack.rb)

Profiling info (kaminsky):
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/debug PCT_OUT=./pct PCT_FMT="%sym" profile ./gtcd -f ../test/gcp_test.conf
  pct line% ./pct/gtcd.31660/gtcd

Refcount debugging:
  before the #include that eventually references refcnt.h, put
      using namespace std;
      #define VERBOSE_REFCNT 1
