To use this, you must generate an RSA public / private keypair.
Keep the private one, well, private (you'll need it to sign the
broadcast) and put the public one on machines with plcmd_daemon.

openssl genrsa -out key.pem 1024
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out pubkey.pem -outform PEM -pubout

To use:

run plcmd_daemon on every node you have
  (use -p to specify a port if desired)

plcmd -n <nodelist> -c <cmdfile>

nodelist is a list of IP:port pairs
192.168.0.1:8932

etc.
cmdfile contains the text of the command that is passed to system()
