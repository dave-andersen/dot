--------------------------
IMPORTANT LIBASYNC NOTES:
--------------------------

- Always check return values: for example, functions like xdr2bytes()
  and bytes2xdr() return a bool to tell you if the marshal/unmarshal
  was successful.

- Be careful about leaking memory: it's common to use vNew to instantiate
  a new object without the caller keeping a pointer to it.  If you do that,
  you must either
    - be sure to have the object delete itself when it's finished, or
    - make sure the object inserts itself (via the constructor)
      into a list/table, in which case someone will delete the object
      later manually, or
    - make the object referenced counted and have the object store a 
      reference to itself (e.g., in a list) and have someone remove it
      from the list later
