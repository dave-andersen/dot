- Fix caching of descriptor lists in Storage Plugin. Address
associated things like replacement policy, etc.

- Additional tests
   - Delayed writing to better test swarming in SET
   - symlinks;  verify file permissions, etc. with gcp

- Metadata passing

   * get_init (noop storage plugin for get_*)
   * ggcmd
   * pass (ggcmd result) to get_chunk RPC
   
   * postfix / external interface work

- Add version information to the OID

Code

- cancel_chunks in xfer_gtc -- imp for cleaning dsync

- figure out if connection cache functionality can be factored 
out of dht and gtc - DONE

- get descriptors from swarmers
idea - Have a hash of the descriptor list passed to the receiver...
recvr gets identical sources from dht, picks a source to get descriptors
and uses the hash to verify the correctness of the descriptors - 
DONE Test it with more cases in SET

- test with rabin chunking

- have a concept of shared folder in DOT

- bitmaps asynchronous

- make sure opendht interface is still working, need to take care of refreshing
mappings in opendht for long term operation, version numbers between runs etc
since we cant reset DHT everytime.

- have DOT cleanly exit, restart etc..

- cleanup in msrc to make the block to source allocation more efficient

- cleanup in gcp for special casing just a file download

Test framework

- simulate delay in gtc to make tests more meaningful over localhost

- add more tests in the test framework to test corner cases etc.

- automate emulab tests to the best

- some basic output to perform visualization of msrc stuff

dsync - abort ops when the probability of finding something useful is
small. Question -- Are the first few blocks of a file indicative of
the similarity to come?

msrc - expose priority among objects when being transferred.
